# Current state
At the moment the main application uses WPF for rendering. This is slow, however works well enough. I just don't want to write a camera and mesh rendering stuff in OpenGL right now, but the OpenTK protoype looks very promising.

As of right now, the application can read a given STL file and render it.

Next steps:
* Implement slider for single layer path
* Implement slider for complete layer browsing
* Implement a configuration class for some fundamental settings like nozzle width, layer height
