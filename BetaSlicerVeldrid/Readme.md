## STL Files
Interesting C# Project for reading STL files, binary and non binary which uses opengl: https://github.com/batu92k/STL-Viewer

Another project with read and even writing support (writing might be handy in the future)
https://github.com/QuantumConcepts/STLdotNET




## Octoprint uploader
Just discovered this, might be useful in the future: https://github.com/bpopp/OctoprintUploader
Watches a directory and when somethign was changed, the file is uploaded via octoprint
Handy to figure out how the OctoPrint upload works


# Licensing
License is currently being investigated. Project is publicly available on github. 
If it ever becomes commercial problematic libraries can be exchanged later. 
It doesn't make sense to spend time on figuring out the right libraries just because of possible licensing issues
